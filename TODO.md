## Next additions (incremental, with how-to)

- Deterministic RNG across shop and results
  - Add singleton `SeededRng{ std::mt19937_64 gen; uint64_t seed; }`.
  - Seed it in `ExportMenuSnapshotSystem` (use the snapshot `seed` you already write), then store in a singleton before transitioning to Battle.
  - Replace `std::random_device` usages in shop fill, judge variation, and any future random calls with `SeededRng.gen` so outcomes are reproducible.

- Reroll and Freeze in Shop
  - Components: `RerollCost{ base=1, increment=0 }`, `Freezeable{ isFrozen }` on shop items.
  - System `RerollFreezeSystem`: when Reroll button pressed, charge wallet, replace non-frozen shop items using `SeededRng`; keep frozen items.
  - UI: Add “Reroll” button on Shop; click toggles per-item freeze (badge or small icon on the slot).

- Course/tags and synergy counts (display-only)
  - Components on dishes: `CourseTag`, `CuisineTag`, `BrandTag`, `DietaryTag`, `DishArchetypeTag`.
  - System `SynergyCountingSystem`: scan current inventory once per frame on Shop, compute counts per tag set into `SynergyCounts` singleton for UI.
  - Update tooltips to show tags and current set thresholds reached.

- Replace static dish pool with enum values
  - Change `get_default_dish_pool()` to use `magic_enum::enum_values<DishType>()` to derive the pool, optionally filter placeholders.

- Judge profile and base scoring (no pairings yet)
  - Singletons: `JudgeProfileRef{ weights[7] }`, `ScoringConfig{ k }`.
  - Systems: `NormalizationSystem` (compute `ComputedFlavor` via `f(x)=x/(x+k)` and weighted base), `HarmonySystem` (compute `HarmonyScore = 1 - stddev(normalized)`), store per-dish for UI.
  - Use these to compute player/opponent totals deterministically in Results (no random variation).

- Persist `BattleReport` for replay
  - Component `BattleReport{ opponentId, seed, perCourse[], totals }`.
  - On Results, write JSON to `output/battles/results/*.json` using the same seed; load it on replay to reproduce scores and UI.

- Basic pairing rule to start the system
  - Add `PairingAndClashSystem` scaffolding with a single rule: `CourseTag=Drink` adjacent to `Meat` adds small +umami multiplier.
  - Compute per-course additive/multiplicative bonuses (`AppliedBonuses`) and include in final score.

- Combine duplicates into levels
  - Component `Level{ value }` on dishes.
  - System `CombineDuplicates`: when 3 of the same `DishType` are in inventory, merge into one entity with `Level+1` and boosted stats/cost; remove the others.

- Small UX affordances
  - Show price on shop items; show “frozen” badge, and a faint highlight on legal drop targets.
  - In Results, add a “Replay” button once `BattleReport` exists.

- Zing and Body (SAP-style, simple)
  - Zing (attack): [spice ≥ 1] + [acidity ≥ 1] + [umami ≥ 1] → 0–3
  - Body (health): [satiety ≥ 1] + [richness ≥ 1] + [sweetness ≥ 1] + [freshness ≥ 1] → 0–4
  - Examples: FrenchFries → Zing 0, Body 2; Salmon → Zing 3, Body 2
  - Keep synergy (types/pairings/sets) as multipliers/addends applied after base counts; do not modify base Zing/Body.
  - Level scaling: if `Level.value > 1`, multiply both Zing and Body by 2 (post-base, pre-synergy).

- SAP-style combat (replaces judge score model)
  - Head-to-head resolve: front dish vs front dish. Each “bites” the other: Body is reduced by opponent Zing until one hits 0.
  - Events: `OnBiteTaken` fired on each damage tick; `OnDishFinished` fired when Body reaches 0.
  - Round outcome: last team with any dish standing wins. Later we may add a simple “menu quality” tiebreaker.
  - Pairings/clashes as global modifiers (pre-battle):
    - Pairings (e.g., Bread↔Soup) grant +1 Body to all dishes on your team for this battle.
    - Clashes (e.g., Acid↔Dairy) apply −1 Zing to all dishes on your team for this battle.
    - Keep magnitudes tiny and readable; apply after Level scaling.
  - Triggers: keep trigger hooks, but exact trigger list to be decided later.

- Z/B UI and tooltip updates
  - Overlay: draw Zing as a green rhombus with a number (supports 2 digits) at top-left of the sprite.
  - Overlay: draw Body as a pale yellow square with a number at top-right of the sprite.
  - Tooltip grouping: group flavor stats into “Zing stats” (spice, acidity, umami) and “Body stats” (satiety, richness, sweetness, freshness).

- Plan adjustments and deferrals
  - Deferred: `NormalizationSystem`, `HarmonySystem`, `ComputedFlavor`, and judge-weighted base scoring (replaced by SAP-style combat).
  - Deferred: detailed `EffectResolutionSystem` and large JSON-driven effect library; keep minimal hooks only for now.
  - Note: “Scoring sketch (for model 2)” and related judge UI are obsolete for the current gameplay direction.


# TODO
Food-themed async autobattler — ECS design notes

Core loop (async):
- Shop phase: draft 7-course menu from a shop, reroll/freeze, apply foods/techniques.
- Lock-in menu: produce a deterministic battle seed and snapshot.
- Resolve vs opponent asynchronously (course-by-course tasting). Return a match report and rating change.

ECS components (proposed):
- Identity/placement
  - `MenuSlot{ index: 1..7 }` — logical position in the tasting order (left-to-right = appetizer➜dessert).
  - `OwnedBy{ chefId }` — associates entities to a player.
  - `ShopItem{ price, isFrozen, originPack, tier }` — item sitting in shop inventory.
  - `CourseSlotConstraint{ allowedCourses: bitset }` — optionally enforce canonical 7-course template.
- Dish definition
  - `Dish` — tag to mark entities that are selectable menu items.
  - `CourseTag{ course: Appetizer|Soup|Fish|Meat|Drink|PalateCleanser|Dessert|Mignardise }` — `Drink` explicit; keep `Dessert` and `Mignardise` distinct.
  - `CuisineTag{ cuisines: bitset }` — Thai, Italian, Japanese, Mexican, French, etc.
  - `BrandTag{ brands: bitset }` — McDonalds, LocalFarm, StreetFood, etc.
  - `DietaryTag{ tags: bitset }` — Vegan, GlutenFree, Halal, Kosher, Keto.
  - `DishArchetypeTag{ tags: bitset }` — Bread, Dairy, Beverage, Wine, Coffee, Tea, Side, Sauce; drives pairings/clashes.
  - `RarityTier{ tier: 1..6 }` — unlock cadence and shop odds.
  - `FlavorStats{ satiety, sweetness, spice, acidity, umami, richness, freshness }` — ints (0..n), balance axes.
  - `TechniqueStats{ smoke, ferment, fry, roast, sousVide, raw }` — technique intensities.
- Triggers/effects (SAP-like power system)
  - `Trigger{ hook: OnBuy|OnSell|OnPlace|OnAdjacentChange|OnCourseServed|OnCourseResolved|OnTeamSynergyChanged|OnReroll }`.
  - `EffectList{ effects: [EffectId...] }` — references data-driven effect definitions.
  - `Aura{ radius: 1|global, statMods, tagMods }` — passive buffs to neighbors/team.
  - `StatusEffect{ name, stacks, durationCourses }` — e.g., PalateCleanser, Heat, SweetTooth, Fatigue.
  - `OneShot{ consumed }` — single-use (e.g., flambé showpiece).
- Synergy accounting
  - `SynergyCounts{ byCuisine[], byCourse[], byBrand[], byDietary[], byTechnique[] }` — computed each phase.
  - `SetBonus{ id, tierReached, bonusApplied }` — e.g., All Thai 2/4/6 thresholds.
- Evaluation caches (ephemeral per evaluation)
  - `ComputedFlavor{ normalized[7] }` — normalized flavor stats for scoring/UI.
  - `HarmonyScore{ value }` — 1 − stddev of normalized stats.
  - `AppliedBonuses{ additive, multiplicative }` — rollup from sets, pairings, clashes, auras, sequences.
- Shop/phase/state
  - `Wallet{ gold }`, `RerollCost{ base, increment }`, `Freezeable`.
  - `ShopInventory{ slots: [entityIds] }` — references `ShopItem` or `Dish` entities.
  - `PhaseState{ phase: Shop|LockIn|Resolving, turnIndex }`.
  - `SeededRng{ seed }` — ensures determinism across async resolve.
- Match/world context
  - `JudgeProfileRef{ id }`, `ScoringConfig{ k, weights[7] }` — controls normalization and flavor weights.
  - `WeeklyMeta{ judgeProfileId, bannedTags[], packRotationId }`, `SeasonTag{ season }`.
- Battle result
  - `CourseScore{ slotIndex, scoreBreakdown }`, `MatchScore{ total, deltas }`.
  - `BattleReport{ opponentId, seed, outcome }` — persisted for replay.

ECS systems (proposed):
- Phase & shop
  - `PhaseSystem` — drives Shop→LockIn→Resolving.
  - `ShopGenerationSystem` — populate shop per `turnIndex`, `RarityTier`, and packs.
  - `PurchaseSystem` — spend `Wallet`, move `Dish` from shop to `MenuSlot`.
  - `SwapPlaceSystem` — reorder dishes, enforce 7-slot constraint.
  - `RerollFreezeSystem` — reroll shop using `SeededRng`, toggle freeze.
  - `ConstraintValidationSystem` — enforce `CourseSlotConstraint` on placement/swap.
  - `WeeklyMetaSystem` — apply bans/weights/pack rotations from `WeeklyMeta`.
- Team evaluation
  - `NormalizationSystem` — compute `ComputedFlavor` using `ScoringConfig.k` and judge weights.
  - `HarmonySystem` — compute `HarmonyScore` per dish.
  - `SynergyCountingSystem` — compute `SynergyCounts` from current menu.
  - `AuraApplicationSystem` — apply `Aura` to neighbors/team; generate temporary stat mods.
  - `PairingAndClashSystem` — evaluate pairing/clash rules to modify `AppliedBonuses`.
  - `SequenceBonusSystem` — evaluate chain rules (e.g., Heat Crescendo) and modify `AppliedBonuses`.
  - `BonusAggregationSystem` — merge set, adjacency, pairings, clashes, sequences, and auras into `AppliedBonuses`.
  - `TriggerDispatchSystem` — fire `Trigger` hooks and enqueue effects.
  - `EffectResolutionSystem` — deterministic queue runner for data-driven effects.
- Battle/resolve
  - `CoursePairingSystem` — align slot i vs slot i, inject `OnCourseServed` hooks.
  - `ScoringSystem` — compute per-course and total using explicit scoring flow.
  - `JudgeSummarySystem` — produce readable report and deltas (ELO/health/hearts).
  - `PersistenceSystem` — store `BattleReport` and allow replay.
- UI glue (later)
  - `ShopUISystem`, `MenuLayoutSystem` (7-slot line), `ReportUISystem` (surface `ComputedFlavor`, `HarmonyScore`, `AppliedBonuses`).

Battle/comparison models (choose one to start):
1) SAP-style “attack/health” analogue (tactical, order matters)
   - Interpret `FlavorStats` to derived `punch` (offense) and `stability` (defense).
   - On serve, a dish “hits” the opposing dish: spice/acidity reduce stability; sweetness/richness buffer.
   - Pros: emergent interactions; familiar. Cons: abstraction leap from food to combat.

2) Pairwise tasting score (recommended starting point)
   - Slot i vs slot i. Compute `courseScore = baseFlavorScore × synergyMultiplier + triggerBonuses − clashPenalties`.
   - Fire hooks: `OnCourseServed` (adjacency/pairing), `OnCourseResolved` (chain effects to next slot).
   - Pros: very readable, food-first fantasy, easier to balance.

3) Judge panel weighting
   - Three judges with different weights (e.g., Satiety/Technique/Novelty). Total = weighted average.
   - Pros: variety; weekly metas. Cons: more numbers to surface.

Judging System Implementation:
- Three celebrity chef judges (references to real chefs) will evaluate dishes
- Layout: [Your Team] [Judges] [Opponent Team] - arranged left to right
- Animation: Feed judges one dish at a time, going left to right through the 7-course menu
- Scoring visualization: Bar along left column with handle that moves:
  - Down away from your team if opponent is winning after that dish
  - Up towards your team if you are winning after that dish
- Winner determination: Final handle position after all dishes determines winner
- Victory animation: Screen pushes off loser team and judges, revealing winner

Scoring sketch (for model 2):
- Normalization: `f(x) = x / (x + k)` using `ScoringConfig.k` per tier/season.
- Judge-weighted base: `base = Σ(weights[i] * f(stat[i]))` from `JudgeProfileRef`.
- Harmony addend: `harmony = 1 − stddev(normalizedStats)`; add scaled harmony to base.
- Additive/multiplicative bonuses: per dish, compute `AppliedBonuses{ additive, multiplicative }` from sets, adjacency pairings, sequences; clashes contribute negative multiplicative.
- Final per-dish: `(base + harmonyAdd + additive) × (1 + multiplicative)`.

Food synergies (examples):
- Set synergies (thresholds 2/4/6)
  - All Thai: +spice cap, +freshness; unlock “Herb Garden” trigger.
  - All Dessert: +sweetness scaling; “Sugar Rush” triggers at slot 6–7.
  - All McDonalds (brand): cheap, consistent; +satiety, −freshness.
  - Dietary: Vegan set grants freshness/harmony; Keto adds satiety/richness.
- Cross-course chains
  - Heat Crescendo: spice increases across slots → extra harmony points if monotonic.
  - Palette Arc: Rich→Acidic→Fresh sequence gives a cleansing bonus at 5th slot.
- Pairings/adjacency
  - Beverage pair: `CourseTag=Drink` next to `Meat` grants +umami and removes clash penalties.
  - Bread Service: `Raw` technique next to `Soup` yields satiety buffer.
- Technique sets
  - Two sous-vide dishes: +tenderness (stability); Add `OnCourseResolved` mini-buff.
- Seasonal/locale
  - Summer produce: +freshness; conflicts with `Ferment` unless mitigated by `CuisineTag=Korean`.

Data-driven content plan:
- Author dishes, triggers, and effects in JSON using `nlohmann/json`.
- Effect schema: `{ id, when: TriggerHook, ops: [ { op: "AddStat", stat: "spice", amount: 2 }, { op: "AddStatus", name: "PalateCleanser", durationCourses: 1 } ] }`.
- Dish schema: `{ name, tier, tags: { cuisine: ["Thai"], course: "Soup" }, flavor: {...}, technique: {...}, effects: ["thai_herbs_aura"] }`.
 - Judge profiles: `{ id, weights: { satiety, umami, sweetness, spice, acidity, richness, freshness }, k }`.
 - Pairing rules: `{ id, when: Adjacent|SameCourse|CrossSlot, require: { left: [tags], right: [tags] }, add: { mult:+0.03, add:+0.00 }, mitigatesClashIds: ["acid_dairy"] }`.
 - Clash rules: `{ id, when: Adjacent|Paired, require: { a: [tags], b: [tags] }, add: { mult:-0.05 } }`.
 - Sequence rules: `{ id, window: { start:1, end:4 }, stat: "spice", monotonic: "nondecreasing", add: { mult:+0.04 } }`.
 - Dish additions: include `archetypeTags: ["Bread", "Dairy", "Beverage", ...]`.

Implementation milestones:
1) Add components: `Dish`, `MenuSlot`, `CourseSlotConstraint`, `FlavorStats`, `CuisineTag`, `CourseTag`, `DishArchetypeTag`, `BrandTag`, `DietaryTag`, `RarityTier`, `Trigger`, `EffectList`, `Aura`, `Wallet`, `ShopItem`, `PhaseState`, `SeededRng`, `JudgeProfileRef`, `ScoringConfig`.
2) Implement `ShopGenerationSystem`, `PurchaseSystem`, `SwapPlaceSystem`, `RerollFreezeSystem`, `ConstraintValidationSystem`, `WeeklyMetaSystem` with deterministic RNG.
3) Implement evaluation core: `NormalizationSystem`, `HarmonySystem`, `SynergyCountingSystem`, `AuraApplicationSystem`.
4) Implement bonuses and scoring: `PairingAndClashSystem`, `SequenceBonusSystem`, `BonusAggregationSystem`, `CoursePairingSystem`, `ScoringSystem`, `JudgeSummarySystem`.
5) Author content: initial pack (20–30 dishes), 6–8 effects, 6–10 pairing/clash rules, 1–2 sequence rules, and 1 judge profile.
6) Wire `ReportUISystem` to display per-course breakdown and totals with breakdowns.

Async/determinism notes:
- All shop rolls and effect resolutions must come from `SeededRng` to allow replays and server-side validation.
- Persist `BattleReport{ opponentSnapshot, seed, events }` to reproduce outcomes.

Open questions to decide soon:
- Health model: hearts like SAP vs rating points vs tournament scoring?
- Rounds: fixed 7-course always, or variable with side pairings/beverages?
- Weekly metas: rotate judge weights, banned tags, or pack rotations.

Example menus and scoring (pairwise tasting model)

Assumptions for examples (for clarity, not final numbers):
- Normalization: f(x) = x/(x+3). Equal weights for 7 flavor stats.
- Harmony bonus: +0.10 × harmony (1 − stddev of normalized stats) added to base before multiplier.
- Synergy multiplier: 1 + set bonuses + adjacency pair bonuses − clash penalties.
  - Set bonuses (by cuisine thresholds): 2-piece +0.04, 4-piece +0.09, 6-piece +0.15.
  - Good adjacency pair (e.g., Soup next to Bread, Wine next to Meat): +0.03 each involved dish.
  - Clash (e.g., very acidic vs dairy, very spicy vs delicate dessert): −0.05 each involved dish.

- Total ≈ 3.37

Notes:
- These numbers are illustrative to show how base, harmony, and multipliers combine. The exact weights and thresholds should be tuned in content.

## Flavor-trigger model v0 (SAP-inspired, chef-unique)

Goals:
- Make flavorful, readable abilities that feel culinary, not combat.
- Keep effects data-driven (JSON) and judged per-course with clear hooks.

Triggers (battle-phase oriented):
- OnServe — when this dish is presented to judges.
- OnTaste — when judges taste/evaluate this dish.
- OnPair — when placed adjacent to a complementary neighbor (resolved at serve).
- OnSequence — when a planned flavor progression condition holds (e.g., spice rising across slots).
- OnCourseComplete — after the course resolves (safe point for chain buffs).
- OnSynergyChanged — when cuisine/course/technique set thresholds change (pre-battle/shop time).
- OnClash — when adjacent pair hits a known clash rule.
- OnOverwhelm — when a dish exceeds a stat threshold (e.g., richness ≥ 3).

Effect ops (JSON, composable):
- AddStat{ stat, amount } — modify raw `FlavorStats` for this evaluation window.
- AddBonusAdditive{ amount } — adds to per-dish additive bonus before multiplier.
- AddBonusMultiplicative{ amount } — modifies per-dish multiplier (e.g., +0.03).
- StealStat{ stat, amount, from: Opponent|Adjacent } — transfer along axis.
- RedistributeStat{ from, to, amount } — preserve sum, shift profile.
- CleanseNext{ statuses:[...], count } — remove negative statuses from following dishes.
- CopyStatFromAdjacent{ stat, scale } — model pair carryover.
- GrantStatus{ name, stacks, durationCourses } — e.g., PalateCleanser, Heat, SweetTooth, Fatigue.
- QueueTrigger{ when, payload } — schedule a delayed effect (e.g., next course).

Status effects (short, flavorful):
- PalateCleanser — removes one negative status from the next dish; small freshness add.
- Heat — small +spice; may penalize delicate desserts if unpaired.
- SweetTooth — small +sweetness; reduces harmony if stacked too high.
- Fatigue — slight −freshness, −harmony; decays after 1 course.

Pairings and clashes (rules, not per-dish effects):
- Beverage↔Meat (or Rich mains) → +umami, mitigates smoke/bitter clashes.
- Soup↔Bread → satiety buffer; early-course comfort pairing.
- Acid↔Dairy clash → small multiplicative penalty unless buffered by richness.

Mapping to current dishes (examples using existing `DishType`s):
- Ramen — spice bloom OnServe; sweetness→richness link OnSequence.
- Sushi — fresh cut advantage OnTaste; umami pair addend OnPair.
- Cheesecake — dessert table service OnCourseComplete; sugar rush OnOverwhelm.

Notes:
- Keep numbers small (+1 stat, +0.02–0.04 mult) and scale with tiers.
- Prefer adjacency and sequence readability over opaque global auras early on.
